   <i><b> <p>Introduction to Cars:</p></b>

       <p> Cars, also known as automobiles, are motor vehicles designed primarily for transporting people. Since their invention in the late 19th century, cars have become an essential part of daily life, transforming the way we travel and connect across distances. Powered by internal combustion engines or electric motors, cars come in various types, such as sedans, hatchbacks, SUVs, and sports cars, each catering to different needs and lifestyles.
        
        Over the years, advancements in technology have led to smarter, safer, and more fuel-efficient cars. Modern vehicles often include features like GPS navigation, advanced driver-assistance systems, and hybrid or fully electric powertrains.</p>
